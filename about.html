          <h2>Our mission</h2>
          <p>
            We seek to empower underprivileged youth by giving them access to creativity, music,
            instruments, and therapy. We believe that music has the power to inspire, heal, and
            unite members of a community from all walks of life. The Backstage Pass Project exists
            to open doors so kids who might never have the chance to hold a guitar, write a song, or
            sit front row at a concert can discover their own rhythm and voice — because when a
            young person finds their sound, they find themselves.

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              We envision a world where music is accessible to every young person and serves as a
              tool for personal growth, emotional wellness, and community connection.

            <p>
              Through inclusive programming and youth-driven events, we build a creative ecosystem
              that inspires long-term confidence, belonging, and opportunity.

            <h3>What makes us different</h3>
            <p>
              We don’t just teach music — we create experiences, and we are youth-led and created.
              Concerts, open-mic nights, workshops, school partnerships, and hands-on projects let
              youth step into the spotlight, feel valued, and connect with peers.

          <h2>Our story</h2>
          <p>
            What started as a small movement in Cleveland is growing into a vision for a connected
            network of musicians, schools, and communities united by the transformative power of
            music. We have seen the spark in kids who hit their first chord or hear live music for
            the first time. The Backstage Pass Project is led by co-board directors Casie Baker,
            Chase Takaoka, and Colson Baker, and powered by a growing network of mentors who believe
            in the same mission.
